I spent the whole day running around caverns. And that's it. End entry.

Just kidding.

It's kind of amazing how I've come to crave being around other androids like me, on my team. We all used to be such loners, but now we know that we might split the rewards if one of us found a site too bit to dig out alone. Of course, one of us may try to steal a dig site from the other. Such is life.

And it is life.

As I sit here, on the edge of the lava tube I climbed out of, I'm looking at the countless stars. I wonder on how many of those planets out there are beings like us. Beings that were created for some simple purpose, but ended up evolving or being guided into so much more.

The stars always make me feel like I'm not alone.
